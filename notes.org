   Each artist is wrapped in `#ARTIST` tags. Every line that begins with a `#`
   is considered a metadata line. Each album is wrapped in `#ALBUM` tags, and
   each track is denoted by `#TRACK`. Metadata for tracks follows this pattern:

   #ARTIST <artist name>
   #ALBUM <album title>
   #TRACK <track name>
   ##<track no>
   <lyrics>
   #/TRACK
   #/ALBUM
